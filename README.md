## üí° Inspiration
Walking alongside the streets in our neighborhood, we can't help but notice the beautiful variety of plants thriving in our urban ecosystem. Beneath this seeming affluence, however, the danger of non-native species--or invasive species--cannot be ignored. Indeed, the introduction of alien species into a new ecosystem may lead to economic, environmental, and human health damages. Research suggests that these invasive species compete with native species for nutrients, space, and sunlight, often leading to soil erosion, decreased biodiversity, deteriorated water quality, and poorer agricultural lands. According to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), invasive species have contributed to the decline of 42% of U.S. endangered and threatened species, and invasives are in fact the main cause for 18% of those declines.

As high school students, we believe this is a vital yet largely marginalized issue that demands closer inspection by society. We, therefore, decided to use this hackathon as an opportunity to combat the crisis of growing invasive species across our communities, and we took on an innovative approach to this problem: EcoDefender.

## üì∑ What it does
EcoDefender combats the issue of invasive species by encouraging the general public, rather than just government officials, to participate in the process of identifying and reporting potential invasive species. EcoDefender is extremely easy to use. First, users open either our web app or the app installed on their phone and use their camera to take a photo of potential invasive species. Our machine learning algorithm will process the image and identify the type of species shown in the picture, and, depending on the location of the user, determine whether this particular species is considered invasive.

Next, users can report their findings to city officials by submitting relevant data on our app. Subsequently, their reported data will be combined with geographical software that will flag all places with reported invasive plants. This allows officials to closely examine the possible patterns in the distribution of invasive species and determine their potential origins. EcoDefender also includes explanations of what an invasive species is, further encouraging the general public to take part in this environmental initiative.

## üíª How we built it
After hours of brainstorming, research, and planning, we decided to split our work by assigning Chris to app prototyping, Jesse to machine learning model development, and Jarvis and Alan to front-end development.

Overall, we trained the machine learning model for classifying plants with Teachable Machine, obtaining a TensorFlow.js model that's incorporated on our website. We built this project using HTML and CSS for the front-end, and also made a prototype app using Figma.

## üö® Challenges we ran into
As the backbone of our project is a machine learning model, obtaining a reliable and reasonably large dataset on different invasive plants was difficult. While there are no publicly available datasets, we managed to

In addition, we also had to navigate through platforms that we are unfamiliar with, including Figma and Qoom. Although these technologies were foreign to us at first, learning them throughout this hackathon was a truly rewarding experience.

## üö© Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are very proud of the fact that we were able to apply machine learning to contribute to the environment around us. This is the first time we implemented computer vision technology to help the general public identify potentially hazardous species, and it was gratifying to see how a technology that appears aloof and impersonal can be utilized to create genuine positive change.

As this is the first Hackathon for many of us, we are also proud of the relative completeness of our project. Learning many foreign platforms and technologies, while experimenting with the coding languages we knew before, was a memorable and satisfying experience.

## üè´ What we learned
In terms of software and design, we gained experience with Qoom and Figma, two platforms that were alien to us before the Hackathon. We also learned more about the danger of invasive species to society through research.

## ü§† What's next for EcoDefender
Because of the time constraint of the hackathon, we were unable to produce an actual app that can be installed on users' phones. In addition, the geofencing feature is only modeled but not realized in our project. Moving forward, we wish to develop a real app for EcoDefender and include the map locations feature on our platforms. Furthermore, to bring about true changes, we also need to further advertise our product and collaborate with local officials. Although EcoDefender is far from perfect now, we are confident that it will ultimately evolve to be a true ecosystem defender, protecting our environment from alien invasion.
